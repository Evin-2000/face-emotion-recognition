Facial Expression Recognition using VGG19

#Overview

This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using the VGG19 deep learning model. The dataset used is a combination of FER, CK+, and KDEF. The model is trained to classify facial expressions into eight categories:

Anger

Contempt

Disgust

Fear

Happiness

Sadness

Surprise

Neutral

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, and training using transfer learning with VGG19.

#Requirements

Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the code:
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scikit-plot
